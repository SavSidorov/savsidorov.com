		"author": "Peter Thiel",

The point is to hang out with Douglas Hofstadter and see what intellectual pathway he’ll take you down next. It’s almost like a nonfiction Alice in Wonderland.",

Though not without its own original ideas - the concept of 'owned space' is one that I think about a lot, for example.",

This is a collection of some of his most popular writings on unqualified-reservations.org, delving into an analysis of our current political system from a Machiavellian perspective (see: Burnham, The Machiavellians).
