		"author": "Peter Thiel",
		"review": "This book introduced me to the world of tech startups and has probably had the biggest impact on me as a person. Superficially a book of business advice, what it’s actually about is philosophy – specifically how to think critically, dream big and do exceptional work.",

		"review": "This book blew my mind. Though, the way that it’s written is certainly not for everyone. It’s light on technical game theory, and more so provides a way of thinking. “A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.”",

The point is to hang out with Douglas Hofstadter and see what intellectual pathway he’ll take you down next. It’s almost like a nonfiction Alice in Wonderland.",
